<p>Since <a href="http://hospitalrun.io/blog/2017/05/announcing-hospitalrun-1.0.0-beta">Announcing the Release of the HospitalRun 1.0 beta</a>, we’ve had almost <strong>1,000 downloads</strong> of the <a href="http://hospitalrun.io/tryit">desktop build</a> and many more have deployed the <a href="https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md">server installation</a>.</p>

<p>Good news: people are starting to use HospitalRun.</p>

<p>Better news: we need your help.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use = a need for support</li>
  <li>A Need for Support = an opportunity to help</li>
  <li>An Opportunity to help = <em>you</em> getting involved and invested in HospitalRun</li>
</ul>

<p>We’d like to stand up a <a href="http://discourse.com">Discourse</a> instance for user and installation support. To do that, we need someone in the community to commit to the care and feeding of said discussion board.</p>

<p>Ideally, we’re invite someone to <strong>lead</strong> our user community management function. Maybe that’s you.</p>

<p>If you’re interested, let’s talk. <a href="mailto:joel@hospitalrun.io">Email me</a> or find me on the project <a href="https://hospitalrun-slack.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a>. Find me at <a href="https://hospitalrun.slack.com/messages/@tangollama/">@tangollama</a>.</p>
